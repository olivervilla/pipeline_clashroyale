# Project
Building a Data Pipeline from Clash Royale API

## Objective
To create a data pipeline that extracts data from the Clash Royale API, transforms it into a structured format, and loads it into a PostgreSQL database for reporting and analysis. The project will also involve storing raw data in MongoDB for data exploration and archival purposes.

## Tools and Technologies

1. Python: For building data processing scripts and data pipeline orchestration.

2. PostgreSQL: For storing structured data in a relational database for reporting and analysis.

3. MongoDB: For storing raw data in a NoSQL database for data exploration and archival purposes.

4. Apache Airflow: For orchestrating the data pipeline and scheduling data processing tasks.

5. PyMongo: For connecting to and interacting with MongoDB from Python.

6. Psycopg2: For connecting to and interacting with PostgreSQL from Python.

7. JSON: For storing and exchanging data between different components of the data pipeline.

## Steps

### Step 1: Data Extraction

1. Register a developer account on the Clash Royale API website and obtain an API key.

2. Use Python requests library to make HTTP requests to the Clash Royale API endpoints and extract data in JSON format.

3. Explore the API documentation to identify the data endpoints you need to extract. Examples of endpoints could include player data, battle logs, and card information.

4. Extract the data using appropriate API calls, and save the response data in JSON format.

### Step 2: Data Transformation

1. Load the raw JSON data into Python using the json library.

2. Clean the data by removing duplicates, invalid entries, and irrelevant information.

3. Convert the data types to the appropriate format. For example, convert timestamps to datetime objects, and numerical data to the appropriate data type.

4. Filter out any data that is not required for your analysis or reporting.

5. Save the transformed data as a new JSON file, or load it into a Python data structure such as a dictionary or list.

### Step 3: Data Storage

1. Store the raw JSON data in a MongoDB database using PyMongo.

2. Define the schema for the PostgreSQL database, and create the required tables to store the structured data.

3. Use Psycopg2 to connect to the PostgreSQL database from Python.

4. Load the transformed data into the PostgreSQL database tables.

### Step 4: Data Pipeline Orchestration

1. Use Apache Airflow to create a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) that defines the workflow for the data pipeline.

2. Define the tasks in the DAG, such as data extraction, transformation, and loading.

3. Schedule the DAG to run at specific intervals, such as hourly or daily.

4. Monitor the progress of the data pipeline, and handle any errors or failures that occur during the workflow.

### Step 5: Data Reporting and Analysis

1. Use SQL queries to extract the required data from the PostgreSQL database tables.

2. Use Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, or Seaborn to perform data analysis and visualization.

3. Generate reports or dashboards that provide insights into the data.

### Step 6: Data Exploration

1. Use PyMongo to connect to the MongoDB database and retrieve the raw data.

2. Perform exploratory data analysis on the raw data to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies.

3. Use Python libraries such as Pandas or NumPy to perform statistical analysis on the raw data.

### Step 7: Data Archiving

1. Store the processed data in a long-term storage solution, such as Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage.

2. Define a backup and recovery strategy to ensure the data is protected and can be restored in case of data loss or corruption.

3. Define retention policies for the archived data to ensure compliance with any regulatory or legal requirements.

These steps provide a high-level overview of the data pipeline building process. The specific implementation details will depend on the data sources, tools, and technologies used in the project.

This project can be expanded upon by adding more data sources, integrating additional technologies, or implementing more complex data processing logic. Additionally, you can add data quality checks and data validation techniques to ensure the data pipeline produces accurate and reliable results.
